On the backend side, I implemented 3 APIs according to our requirements.
1. GET: /cars
2. GET: /cars/{id}
3. POST: /cars/{id}

The application has three pages: a car listing page (first page), a view car information page, and a new car addition page.

The first page (the car listing page) has two events and one request.
- Get all data from backend and display it.
- When the user clicks the Add button, they are taken to the Add New Car page.
- When the user clicks the view button, it moves to the vehicle information view page.

On the View Vehicle Information page:
- Get data according to selected id from backend and display it.

On the Add New Car page:
- User can add new car information
- After adding vehicle information, go to the first page.
